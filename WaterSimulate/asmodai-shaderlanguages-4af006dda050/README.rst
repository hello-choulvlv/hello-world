About
=====

ShaderLanguages is a `Sublime Text 2`_ syntax highlighting package for the
`High Level Shader Language`_, `OpenGL Shader Language`_, `CG C for Graphics`_ and
`Unity ShaderLab`_.

Installation
------------

This package has been submitted to the `Package Control`_ index and will hopefully soon be
available in the main list. You can then install it via the Command Palette (CTRL + Shift + P),
typing `install` and selecting `Package Control: Install Package`. In the subsequent popup text box
type `shader` and pick the `ShaderLanguages` package.

In the meantime, or if you do not use Package Control, download a `zip`_ or `tarball`_ archive,
extract the archive, rename the directory to `ShaderLanguages` and simply drop this directory into
your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory.

You are then able to set the syntax from the Command Palette.

Compiling CG Shaders
====

To successfully compile cg shaders, the `Nvidia CG Toolkit`_ must be installed and linked in the PATH environment variable.
(You must be able to run cgc from the console.)

NOTE
====

These syntax highlighting files are a work in progress and will still not highlight
all aspects of the shader language files. Please be patient.
